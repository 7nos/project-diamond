Proposed short description (one-line)
Responsive diamond-shaped UI component and demo (HTML/CSS) — small, reusable frontend snippet.

What this repository contains
- Minimal HTML and CSS demonstrating a "diamond" visual element (shape, layout, and responsive behavior)
- Simple demo page(s) you can open in a browser
- Documentation (this README) to explain how to use, modify, and integrate the component

Goals and intended audience
- Provide a lightweight, dependency-free example of a diamond-shaped UI component
- Help front-end learners and designers quickly reuse or adapt the design
- Serve as a portfolio/demo piece for the author

Quick demo / How to view
1. Clone the repository:
   - git clone https://github.com/7nos/project-diamond.git
2. Open the demo file (e.g., index.html) in any modern browser:
   - Open file in browser or run a simple local server (e.g., `python -m http.server` in repo root)
3. The demo shows a diamond-shaped element styled with CSS. Resize the window to see responsive behavior.

Usage
- Copy the HTML snippet and CSS rules from the demo pages into your project.
- Customize colors, sizes, and layout according to your design.
- No JS required for basic visuals.

File structure (example)
- index.html — demo page (open in browser)
- styles.css — styling for the diamond component and layout
- README.md — this file
- (Add other files as needed: images, examples, alternate layouts)

Tech stack

- CSS (modern features, responsive design)
- Optional: tiny JS additions for interactive demos (not required)
